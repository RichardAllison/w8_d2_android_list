# ListView Custom ArrayAdapter Homework

Hey E18! Let's practise creating a listView using a custom ArrayAdapter in an Android App!

Tonight's homework is to create a new Android app that displays a collection of THINGS OF YOUR CHOICE in a list. It could be different types of trees, a songs chart, comics, pizzas, bears, or whatever you feel like.

## MVP
- Create a model that returns an ArrayList of your objects.
- Create an activity and arraylist adapter that populates a listview with your collection.

## Extensions
- Include an image for each list item
- Read the information here: https://gist.github.com/futuresocks/8cd6073ce625c880d21c7f623c07ea51 and then add an onClick to the list items that displays the object's information on a new activity.
